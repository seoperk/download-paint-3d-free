                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Paint 3D, launched by Microsoft with the Windows 10 Creators Update, brought simple yet powerful 2D painting combined with beginner-friendly 3D modeling to millions of users. It allowed anyone to doodle, add 3D shapes, apply stickers, and create fun mixed-reality experiences without needing advanced skills. In 2026, many still seek this free tool for quick edits, school projects, or casual 3D experimentation. This guide explains where and how to download Paint 3D safely today, its current availability, and why it remains popular despite changes from Microsoft.</p>
                <p>Whether you're on Windows 10 or 11, Paint 3D offers an intuitive canvas for creativity. For more resources and tutorials, visit <a href="https://thepaint3d.com" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Paint 3D</a>.</p>

            <section id="status">
                <h2>Current Status in 2026</h2>
                <p>Microsoft officially deprecated Paint 3D and removed it from the Microsoft Store starting November 4, 2024. Existing installations continue to function normally, but new downloads are no longer available directly through the official Store app search. This decision stemmed from low usage compared to the refreshed classic Paint app and a shift toward AI-enhanced tools. However, the app was never truly "shut down"—it's still usable, and legitimate archived or third-party trusted sources provide safe access to the installer packages.</p>
                <p>In 2026, community interest remains strong, especially among users who prefer its unique 3D doodle and sticker features over newer alternatives. Don't worry—safe download options exist if you know where to look.</p>

                <h2>Official & Safe Sources</h2>
                <p>The safest approach is using archived Microsoft Store packages from reputable generators or trusted mirror sites that host original .appx/.msix files. Avoid random third-party sites claiming "Paint 3D.exe" as they often bundle unwanted software.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft Store Archive Tools</strong>: Use community tools like the Microsoft Store Generation Project to generate direct download links from the official app ID (9NBLGGH5FV99). Paste the Store URL into these generators for clean, virus-free packages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trusted Mirrors</strong>: Sites like thepaint3d.com or softonic.com offer verified downloads of the latest available version (around 6.2410.x). These mirrors frequently update and scan files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Softonic / Uptodown</strong>: Long-standing download portals with security checks and user reviews provide safe Paint 3D installers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Always scan downloaded files with Windows Defender or a trusted antivirus before installing.</p>

                <h2>How to Download & Install Paint 3D</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps for a smooth installation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visit a trusted source like <a href="https://thepaint3d.com" target="_blank">Paint 3D</a> or use a Store link generator with the app ID.</li>
                    <li>Download the .appx or .msixbundle file (usually 50–100 MB).</li>
                    <li>Double-click the file. Windows may prompt for App Installer—if missing, install it from the Microsoft Store first.</li>
                    <li>Click "Install" and wait for completion.</li>
                    <li>Launch Paint 3D from the Start menu. If issues arise, right-click the file → "Install for all users" or use PowerShell: <code>Add-AppxPackage -Path "path\to\file.appx"</code>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Tip: If you're on a fresh Windows install, enable sideloading in Settings → Privacy & security → For developers.</p>
